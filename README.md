I know these are long, but they account for nearly every case an autograder might test for.

The tests will print to the console about a failure the tested code has (esp exception testing),
however, I'm too lazy to spell out all the other errors this test might find lmao, so keep that in mind and make sure
you're following the instructions to a T, as that, along with a few instructor comments about the assignment 
on Piazza, is the basis for these tests. If you do run into an error that the test doesn't print about, then either the code
most likely is really screwed up somewhere, or I did, so make sure you look into the specific lines the test fails the 
code at and consider why it throws such an error. If I did make a mistake, lmk pls~
