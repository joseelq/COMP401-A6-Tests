I know these are long, but they account for nearly every case.

The tests will print to the console about the failures for most of the notable errors that will be thrown,
however, I'm too lazy to spell out all the errors this test might find lmao, so keep that in mind and make sure
you're following the instructions to a T, as that, along with a few instructor comments about the assignment 
on Piazza, is the basis for this test.
