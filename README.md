I know these are long, but they account for nearly every case.

The tests will print to the console about the failures for many of the notable errors that could be thrown,
however, I'm too lazy to spell out all the errors this test might find lmao, so keep that in mind and make sure
you're following the instructions to a T, as that, along with a few instructor comments about the assignment 
on Piazza, is the basis for these tests.
